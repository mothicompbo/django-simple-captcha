In this article, we will explain what causes this error and how to fix it.
 
## What Causes Rufus Error Access To The Device Is Denied?
 
There are several possible reasons why Rufus may fail to access the USB device and show this error. Some of the common causes are:
 
- The USB drive is corrupted or has bad sectors. This can make the USB drive unreadable or unwritable by Rufus.
- The USB drive is already in use by another program or process. This can create a conflict and lock the USB drive from Rufus.
- The USB drive is protected by antivirus software or Windows security features. This can block Rufus from accessing the USB drive and modifying its contents.
- The USB drive is formatted with an incompatible file system or partition scheme. This can prevent Rufus from recognizing the USB drive and creating a bootable disk.

## How to Fix Rufus Error Access To The Device Is Denied?
 
To fix this error, you need to identify and eliminate the cause of the problem. Here are some possible solutions that you can try:

1. Check and repair the USB drive for errors. You can use Windows built-in tools like Disk Management or Diskpart to scan and fix the USB drive for errors. Alternatively, you can use Rufus itself to check the USB drive for bad blocks by clicking on "Show advanced format options" and then "Check device for bad blocks".[^3^] [^4^]
2. Close any other programs or processes that may be using the USB drive. You can use Task Manager or Resource Monitor to see what programs or processes are accessing the USB drive and end them. You can also try unplugging and replugging the USB drive or using a different USB port.
3. Disable or whitelist Rufus in your antivirus software or Windows security settings. Some antivirus software or Windows security features like Controlled Folder Access may interfere with Rufus and prevent it from accessing the USB drive. You can try disabling these features temporarily or adding Rufus as an allowed app in your antivirus software or Windows security settings.[^1^] [^2^]
4. Format the USB drive with a compatible file system and partition scheme. You can use Rufus itself to format the USB drive by selecting the appropriate options under "Device", "Boot selection", "Partition scheme" and "File system". You may need to choose between GPT and MBR partition schemes depending on your target system's BIOS or UEFI mode.[^3^]

If none of these solutions work, you may need to try a different USB drive or a different tool for creating bootable disks.
 
## Conclusion
 
Rufus is a handy tool for creating bootable USB drives from ISO files, but it may sometimes encounter an error that says "Access to the device is denied". This error can be caused by various factors such as a corrupted USB drive, a conflicting program or process, a blocking antivirus software or Windows security feature, or an incompatible file system or partition scheme. To fix this error, you need to identify and eliminate the cause of the problem by following some of the possible solutions we have provided in this article.
